# CryptoProject

### To Do List
- [x] Setup Environment for Project Website.
- [ ] Create intuitive and explanantory page of the rabin miller prime check algo.
- [ ] Add other popular methods of prime checking (eg. Fermat, Solvay-Strassen etc.)
- [ ] Setup easy way to demo the project (maybe gitpod).
### Instructions for developer
- Check if you have docker. 
Use `docker --version`  and `docker-compose --version`. If there are no errors you can move on to step 2. Else check (error\not installed) [here](https://docs.docker.com/) for best resolution.
- Clone your repo and move into work directory. Use `git clone` or dowload zip to view the project in your local device. 
-  Create Docker image and run it! Use `docker build -t {name_of_image} .` to create the image and `docker run -it {name_used_above}` to run the image. A hyperlink will be shown as a result by clicking the link you will be directed to the service.
- Edit. You can change the application process as you like and see fit! Just be careful whenever you update the repo to specify the erroror other relavent info in this file.
- ( Ignore if u know ;> ) Update the repo! Try a `git status` to find what all changes you have made to the repo since cloning. If not change exists do not update. Else do `git add .` and `git commit -m {title/msg of change}` check if git api has accepted the changes by checking git status again. Do a `git push` to finally update the repo.
### Notes
- Update 1.0: UI and Website design requires alot of work. No errors.
